## unRAID-CA-templates

An [Unraid](https://discord.gg/qWPbc8R) community repo where you can request Unraid container templates to be added to Community Applications: [Squidly271/community.applications](https://github.com/Squidly271/community.applications).

### Intent to slow down

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As the personal usage of Unraid of the original creators of this organization has slowed down, so has the interest of maintaining this repo.

There is no active plans to stop providing these templates, but the request part is going away.
Pull requests will still be reviewed.

If you have a app in this repo, I urge you to consider these options for a smooth transition:

- Getting your own template repo in CA
- Move to an alternate repo backed by a active Unraid user in your own community

#### Coordination

Please make a issue in this repo so we can coordinate this move.

### Accepted application terms

For a pull request to be reviewed

- The template must be made by a user with previous activity on GitHub
- The application must be of certain quality
  - Not fully AI written
  - Be attributed to a GitHub account with activity past commits
